Step 1: Install Java
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk  ## Install OpenJDK 8 with:
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk  ## Alternatively, install version 11:

Step 2: Add the Jenkins Repository
1. Start by importing the GPG key:

curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null

2. Next, add the Jenkins software repository to the sources list and provide the key for authentication:

echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null

Step 3: Install Jenkins
1. To install Jenkins on Ubuntu, use the following commands:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install jenkins

2. The system prompts you to confirm the download and installation. Press Y and hit Enter, and the system downloads and installs Jenkins.

3. To check Jenkins was installed and is running enter:

sudo systemctl status jenkins

4. Exit the status screen by pressing Ctrl+Z.

Step 4: Modify Firewall to Allow Jenkins
You need to open Port 8080 to allow Jenkins to communicate.
If you’re using the default UFW firewall, enter the following:

sudo ufw allow 8080
sudo ufw status

Step 5: Set up Jenkins
1. To launch and set up Jenkins, open a web browser, and navigate to the IP address of your server:

http://ip_address_or_domain:8080

Use the actual IP address or domain name for the server you’re using Jenkins on. For example, if you're running locally, use:

http://localhost:8080

2. You should see a page that prompts you to Unlock Jenkins. You’ll need the default password. You can get the default password by switching to a command line and 
entering the following:

sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

3. The system returns an alphanumeric code. Enter that code, then click Continue.

4. Next, you are prompted to either Install suggested plugins or Select plugins to install. It’s fine to simply install the suggested plugins.

You can always install more plugins later. The system continues the initial Jenkins setup.

5. Then you will be prompted to Create First Admin User.

Enter the credentials you want to use for your Jenkins administrator, then Save and Continue.

6. After this, you should set up the Instance Configuration. This is the preferred network address for this Jenkins installation. Confirm the address you want to use for your server. This is most likely the same address you used to get to this configuration page. When you’re satisfied, click Save and Finish.

7. You should see a page that says Jenkins is ready!

You can click Start using Jenkins to open the Jenkins dashboard.
